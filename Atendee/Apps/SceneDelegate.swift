/*
 This is a Swift code snippet defining a static class method rootViewController of the Application_utility class. The method returns the root view controller of the main window in the application.

 The method starts by accessing the connectedScenes property of the shared UIApplication instance, which represents the app's active scenes. It assumes that the first connected scene is the UIWindowScene instance that contains the app's main window. If there is no UIWindowScene, it returns a new, empty UIViewController.

 Next, the method accesses the rootViewController property of the window's main view controller, which is the root view controller of the app. If there is no root view controller, it returns a new, empty UIViewController.

 Overall, this code is useful for obtaining the root view controller of the app, which can be useful for various purposes, such as presenting new view controllers, accessing navigation controllers or tab bar controllers, or obtaining information about the app's state.
